# SDPB Input Format

`SDPB` takes preprocessed input generated by `sdp2input` or `pvm2sdp`.
If you want to modify these files or generate your own input files
with a separate tool, this documents the format you will need to follow.

`sdp2input` and `pvm2sdp` generate a main zip file containing multiple
JSON files.  They do not enable compression, because that can be quite
slow.  Putting everything into a single file makes it easier to
manage.  Also, the zip format has a built-in checksum to detect
corruption.

Inside the zip file, `SDPB` expects to find `control.json`,
`objectives.json`, and a file for every block (`block_0.json`,
`block_1.json`, `block_2.json`, ...)

The main part of `control.json` is listing the number of blocks.
`sdp2input` and `pvm2sdp` will also include a copy of the command used
to create the files, but `SDPB` does not require that.

`objectives.json` includes the constant contribution to the objective,
and 'b', the optimization vector.

The block files contain the dimension, number of points, bilinear
bases, the 'B' matrix, and the 'c' vector.

`SDPB` can also read the input if you pack these files into different
archive formats.  It is limited by the support for
[libarchive](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/wiki/LibarchiveFormats),
but it includes zip, tar, tar.gz, 7z.  If you like, you can also leave
everything in a plain old directory.

The JSON schema for these input files are in
[sdpb_input_control_schema.json](sdpb_input_control_schema.json),
[sdpb_input_objectives_schema.json](sdpb_input_objectives_schema.json),
[sdpb_input_block_schema.json](sdpb_input_block_schema.json).  Running `SDPB` on the
test example

    pvm2sdp 1024 test/data/pvm2sdp/pvm.xml test/out/pvm2sdp/sdp.zip
    
will generate a simple example you can look at.
